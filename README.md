# 2023-DM-Project

## Abstract

 The project addresses the challenge of identifying trending and rare patents in specific industries by providing a solution for technological research and patent applications. Existing patent search services lack the ability to reveal evolving trends within fields, relying on keyword searches. To fill this gap, the project crawls patent data from the 2000s, preprocesses patent names and IPC values, and uses cosine similarity to match user-input keywords with relevant patents. The resulting Main IPC values guide users toward promising technologies. The A-Priori method is then employed to analyze convergence and research frequency of identified IPC technologies, extracting the most and least relevant IPC pairs. This helps identify actively and infrequently associated fields with user-input keywords. The output is a curated list of patents using these IPC pairs, offering insights for designing new business items or research papers. 
 
 In conclusion, the project enhances patent search efficiency and provides a logical analysis of domestic patent trends, offering users a comprehensive understanding of technological developments in their specified fields.
